			"full_description": "Being the treasurer of Australia isn’t easy. Voters only give you a pass mark if you succeed in two very different tasks at the same time. They expect you to prudently balance the federal budget, but they also want you to help balance their own household budget with tax cuts and generous family payments. This is much easier said than done because balancing the federal budget means keeping revenue high and spending low, while supporting family budgets often requires the exact opposite: tax cuts and higher spending. Then-federal treasurer Peter Costello in 2002, when the “baby bonus” was introduced. Credit: This is the basic challenge that has faced every treasurer from the incumbent Josh Frydenberg all the way back to Arthur Fadden in the Menzies government. The maestro in the modern era was, of course, Peter Costello (now chairman of Nine Entertainment, owner of this masthead), who drove the electoral success of the Howard government by consistently delivering both federal surpluses and family tax cuts. Costello’s trick was to implement economic reforms that drove higher productivity and income growth. He then took some of that extra cash to balance the budget and gave the rest back in tax cuts to help household budgets. Costello’s model was an evolution of Paul Keating’s formula, but Costello delivered it more consistently than any treasurer in modern history, thanks to monumental help from the mining boom. But the last two Liberal treasurers, Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison, haven’t followed the Costello/Keating model. In the name of battling the pandemic, they judged that voters would give them a leave pass on the normal laws of good economic management. So they allowed the federal budget to blow out and barely touched economic reform. The Morrison government spent more than any previous government facing a crisis in recent history, increasing public spending by more than 7 per cent of gross domestic product during the pandemic. This compares with the 2.8 per cent Kevin Rudd spent to get us through the global financial crisis and the 3.3 per cent Keating spent during the 1990s recession. It’s even bigger than the 5.5 per cent spending increase introduced by Gough Whitlam in the early 1970s. Voters have turned a blind eye to bulging deficits during the pandemic, but they won’t be so sanguine when they realise that gigantic public spending is one of the factors hurting their cost of living. This massive spending has flooded the economy with cash, fuelled the consumer boom, helped to push prices higher and ultimately put upward pressure on interest rates. As we get past the worst of COVID, the electorate’s economic priorities will change. Voters are already starting to feel the cost-of-living impact of rising petrol, food and other prices. On top of that, families will soon feel the pain of rising mortgage interest rates. Morrison is yet to recognise how the changing economic situation will damage him politically. Right now he’s trumpeting rising employment and strengthening growth as the foundation of his electoral pitch to voters. But macroeconomic bragging doesn’t cut it with voters who are seeing bills pile up. We learned this in the 2007 election when Australians punished the incumbent government despite strong economic growth and high employment. Kevin Rudd, as opposition leader, tapped into deep concern about rising prices for fuel and groceries, rising mortgage interest rates and the skills shortages that were hitting business. We have seen the same in the United States recently where President Joe Biden had hoped that strong employment figures would earn him good economic marks with voters. They haven’t. While US unemployment is near record lows, 65 per cent of Americans are unhappy with the economy’s direction because of runaway inflation that is hiking the cost of everything from food to rent and used cars. Fuel prices hit around $US3.50 ($4.16) a gallon this month (compared with $US2.50 a year ago)> Many petrol stations have posted signs next to the price: “Joe Biden did this”. Biden’s message that the American economy is recovering and jobs are coming back is being drowned out by the daily household reality of a rising cost of living. To avoid the same fate in Australia, both political parties need to rapidly pivot from crisis economics back to Costello economics. Over the course of the next year, they will need policies that address growing voter frustration with rising interest rates, higher living expenses, slow wages growth and skills shortages. That will mean executing a U-turn from the COVID economic policies of big spending back to the hard graft of fiscal consolidation and economic reform. This month, unemployment hit a very low 4.2 per cent. But if Morrison thinks that will be enough to win him the election, he should ask Costello whose government lost in 2007, soon after the unemployment rate had hit an eerily similar low of … 4.2 per cent.",

			"full_description": "Anthony Albanese had to conduct a careful exercise in damage control this week when he made a calculated decision to accept a government migration bill that many of his caucus members have hated for years. The Labor leader and his senior shadow ministers knew they were cornered by Scott Morrison after the Prime Minister challenged them to back a law that could make it easier to deport convicted criminals. So they hit the phones to make sure their critics on the left would understand why Labor had to let the bill pass. Illustration: Simon Letch Credit: It turned into a textbook case for managing a scare campaign in a week of shrill talk and frightening claims on every front. China, of course, most of all. Stakeholders in the migration debate, such as refugee groups and migration experts, saw no need for Morrison to change the “character test” when ministers can already cancel visas on broad grounds, as Novak Djokovic discovered. But Albanese and the key frontbenchers, including home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally and multicultural affairs spokesman Andrew Giles, could see the train wreck ahead if they went to the election blocking a bill that did not give the government the power it wanted to deport someone convicted of assault. Morrison and his MPs threw everything at Labor in Parliament, including the claim that Albanese was soft on domestic violence offenders. The refugee advocates were not happy but they understood Labor’s position. And they had a calculation to make, also. Did they want a Labor government that stops the use of temporary protection visas for thousands of refugees? Or did they assume Labor is certain of victory and could take any political risk in the campaign to come? One of the lessons from the last campaign, according to Labor’s report into why it lost, was that too many stakeholders “banked” a Labor victory and started arguing over the spoils too soon. In the end, of course, they were all left fighting over nothing. This is the reality of managing a scare campaign. Albanese and the leadership team calculated that the danger of a government attack on the “character test” was serious while the actual change to the law was not significant enough to warrant a rejection. This was a backdown – and a humiliating one, according to the government. Immigration Minister Alex Hawke got what he wanted. His success was undercut, however, by his own admission that the government will run out of time to get the bill through the Senate before the election. So it was a wedge, not an urgent change. Even so, Albanese made sure to turn up in Parliament to stand on the same side as Morrison when the vote was held. Labor saw the next scare coming. Morrison signalled in the media he would challenge Labor to pass a change to firearms law that would impose mandatory sentencing on offenders – something caucus members have rejected in the past. This time, however, Albanese knew it would need to pass with Labor’s support. To do otherwise would invite another claim that he was soft on crime. Labor’s manager in the lower house, Tony Burke, moved on Thursday to suspend standing orders and launch the debate on the firearms bill. This took the government by surprise, with no ministers ready to speak, but Dutton responded quickly by putting the bill to a vote as soon as possible. It passed the House. Within minutes, Labor reversed years of policy and sacrificed its old concern that mandatory sentences were wrong because they imposed an outcome on judges. It was another backdown. But it was a rational political move to clear the decks for the election. “It’s going to be an angry, vicious campaign,” says one Labor frontbencher. “They are going to go hard on driving wedges, attacking individual character, relying on fear and stoking division.” The China scare is the big one, of course. Morrison is desperate, shameless and shrill. His claim on Wednesday that Labor deputy Richard Marles was the “Manchurian candidate” was outlandish, false and more than a bit daft. How could it be anything else? It refers to someone being brainwashed by a foreign power and led to commit treason – until the hero of the story stops him. Incredibly, and foolishly, Albanese was stung into repeating the dumb claim himself on Thursday afternoon when he told Parliament that Morrison was the real Manchurian Candidate. He missed the chance to take the high road. He was sucked into the scare. The intervention of the ASIO director-general, Mike Burgess, was badly needed. His interview with Leigh Sales on the ABC’s 7:30 on Wednesday night was compulsory viewing ahead of the election. It bursts the myth of one side being more vulnerable than another on the risk of foreign interference. Still, Morrison has everyone talking about Labor and China. And that is the point. Scare campaigns are ugly but scare campaigns work. Just ask John Howard, who ran hard on border security in 2001 and knocked Labor off-balance well before September 11 changed the election campaign. Knowing that history, Labor caucus members naturally respond to Morrison by complaining about his big scare. But complaining about a scare does not stop it. Having the media on your side does not stop it, either. Labor’s own experience shows how hard it can be to create a strategy to neutralise and defeat a scare. As Labor leader at the 2016 election, Bill Shorten falsely claimed the government had a policy to privatise Medicare. As prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull struggled to dispel the notion because talking about the claim only seemed to spread the vague idea more widely. The China scare can hurt Labor at a time when it looks underpowered on defence and national security. The decision to move Marles out of the defence portfolio and into an economic role, with jobs and reconstruction, now looks unwise. His replacement in the defence portfolio, Brendan O’Connor, is reliable but not aggressive. The shadow attorney-general, Mark Dreyfus, is a barrister rather than the political fighter Labor needs right now. Keneally, however, made attack the best form of defence. She was in the media all week with claims the government was fumbling the character test at the very same time she was getting an agreement inside Labor to neutralise the issue. The contrast between Labor and the Coalition in Parliament raises questions about the strength and energy in the Labor team. Morrison has escalated his rhetoric against Albanese this week with help from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Defence Minister Peter Dutton when the government chooses to kick heads. The fact that they are leadership rivals does not stop them doing the dirty work; in fact, it gives them an incentive. Albanese is his own attack dog. This leaves him exposed to Morrison’s jibe about the “snarling” and “growling” from the man who would be prime minister. Morrison is hardly one to lecture, especially given the incendiary claims this week, but Albanese needs more back-up. Kevin Rudd fought the 2007 campaign with an airy disdain for his opponent while his deputy, Julia Gillard, launched missile after missile at the government. Albanese could do with someone like that. He has kept the caucus together and refused wedges on religion, migration and firearms law. Yet the biggest and most powerful scare has only just started.

			"full_description": "OTTAWA—Political pushback to the government’s decision to deem the ongoing “Freedom Convoy” protests a national emergency began in earnest Thursday. On the first formal day of debate over the measures enacted via the Emergencies Act, the Conservatives and Bloc Québécois aimed their anger not just at the Liberals but also the New Democrats, who’ve offered support to the government’s new rules and regulations designed to end three weeks of protests. Interim Conservative Leader Candice Bergen reaffirmed her party intends to vote against the new measures, saying they are the result of the political failures of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. “This is not a game,” she said. “It comes at the cost to Canadians’ rights and freedoms. Parliament should not allow the prime minister to avoid responsibility in this way. I urge all members of this House: proceed with extreme caution.” The powers were on display in Ottawa as police warned protesters who’ve been camped out for days that they faced arrest and financial penalties if they remained, and banks began to freeze accounts linked to the ongoing demonstrations. As debate got underway, outside, forklifts were placing large concrete blocks at the foot of Parliament Hill and more fences were added to ring the perimeter. Trudeau, and many of his ministers, repeated Thursday that all those measures are in compliance with the Charter, are time-limited, and designed solely to stop what the Liberals say are illegal blockades and occupations causing economic and social damage. “We understand that everyone is tired of this pandemic,” Trudeau said in his address. “We understand that Canadians are frustrated with COVID. Some protesters came to Ottawa to express their frustration and fatigue with public health measures, and that is their right. Like I said, it is a right that we will defend in this free and democratic country. However, illegal blockades and occupations are not peaceful protests. They have to stop.” The debate will continue throughout the weekend, with the vote expected late Monday night. What MPs are voting on specifically is a motion confirming a declaration of a public order emergency, which they are required to do under the Emergencies Act. The Liberals have not clearly answered the question of whether it would be considered a confidence motion, though if Parliament fails to vote in favour of the declaration, it is revoked immediately. MPs can also try to amend elements of the orders. Bloc Québécois Leader Yves François Blanchet said he will be meeting with the NDP later Thursday to see if they can find a mutual understanding. Blanchet’s party opposes the declaration on the basis that it applies in Quebec, even without that province’s consent, and they argue it represents an overreach given that the border blockades which were once part of the protests were resolved using existing police powers. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh framed his party’s decision to support the declaration — for now — in the context of wanting to help workers get back to their jobs, and families needing a reprieve from what’s become a hodgepodge of honking and harassment throughout Ottawa’s downtown core. He also called it a failure of policing, and said there needs to be an inquiry into that element of the demonstrations, including why in some cases police appeared to be supporting and encouraging members of the convoy. “Occupiers get hugs from the police, while Indigenous and racialized protesters are met with the barrel of a gun,” he said.

Atticus, 10, started to have trouble sleeping as the COVID-19 case numbers spiked near his home in Canberra at the start of its two-month lockdown. Atticus, 10, had trouble sleeping during the pandemic. Credit: Alex Ellinghausen “I didn’t necessarily always feel worried, but sometimes I was like ‘it’s getting very, very close’,” Atticus said. Sydney paediatrician Dr Jacqueline Small said many children were struggling with the lingering effects of lockdowns and she had noticed a spike in presentations of children with developmental delays in her practice, reflecting a pattern shown in research. Dr Small, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP), which represents paediatricians and other specialist physicians, said the more serious health impacts of COVID-19 on adults had meant children’s wellbeing had taken “a back seat” but it was “time to put children first”. “Some children seem to have coped well,” she said. “There are others where the loss of learning is very significant.” Melbourne’s Leticia Hodson said living through the city’s six COVID-19 lockdowns, which cumulatively lasted almost a year, had a dramatic impact on her son Wade’s wellbeing. The 10-year-old struggled to readjust at school after living through the world’s longest lockdown in Melbourne. Leticia Hodson says getting through Melbourne’s lockdown was tough on her son Wade.

As the nation opens up, the RACP is calling on both major parties to commit to setting up a National COVID-19 taskforce to lead a recovery plan and a Chief Paediatrician appointed to lead the effort. Liberal backbencher Dr Katie Allen, a paediatrician who worked as a medical researcher before entering Parliament, is backing the RACP campaign alongside Labor’s shadow assistant health minister Ged Kearney, a former nurses’ union secretary. “COVID lockdowns have affected children in ways we don’t yet fully understand,” Ms Allen said. “Getting their social development, education and general wellbeing back on track has to be central to our COVID recovery.” A study published in the peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Pediatrics in October tracked about 6000 Chinese infants before and after the pandemic began, finding a higher risk of delay in fine motor and communication skills among firstborn one-year-olds born from 2020. Dr Small said pandemic-related stress during pregnancy “can affect brain development”, while parents having to juggle more roles while working from home could affect their interactions with children. Then there was “the loss of the extended community and support that children and families engage with when their children are very young,” she said. Dr Small said a combination of factors such as parental stress, including during pregnancy, and a rise in screen use along with a reduction in social connections were thought to be contributing to developmental problems. And, she said, “missing several months of school can really have a significant impact” with research suggesting some children’s learning progression effectively paused for the period of school closures, while opportunities were missed to help vulnerable children. Ms Hodson said she had agonised over the decision to send Wade back to school as Victoria emerged from restrictions while the Omicron variant circulated, “not knowing how the disease would impact him”. “The whole pandemic has been having to choose a path where none of those paths feel acceptable,” she said. During lockdown, she said, “we kept things pretty light around him, but he picked up on the stress of the adults around him”. While Atticus is back at school and feeling more secure after receiving his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, life is still not completely back to normal, with caution among some friends’ parents meaning his social life is still limited. “I feel like it won’t be back to proper normal for a while, but I feel like if this is the best normal we can do, it’s a pretty okay normal,” Atticus said. Data collected by Royal Life Saving Australia shows drowning deaths among children aged four and under increased by 108 per cent in 2021 compared to the previous year, a spike attributed to swimming lessons being cancelled. An Australian study published in Archives of Disease in Childhood showed a 104 per cent increase in children with anorexia nervosa being admitted to hospital for nutritional rehabilitation in 2020 compared with the previous three years. The RACP wants whoever wins government to implement the National Children’s Mental Health and Wellbeing Strategy, a 120-page report detailing ways to improve child mental health and parenting support, which the federal government released in October. More support in schools for students with disability or learning difficulties, universal access to three-year-old preschool and new laws restricting junk food marketing are also on the college’s wishlist.

			"full_description": "The federal director of the Nationals failed to disclose a $1 million payment from a key financial supporter until a federal audit forced the party to reveal the transfer almost two years after the last election. The payment meant the Nationals gained much more support from a private fund than the party claimed in its report to the Australian Electoral Commission, (AEC) in a series of errors identified years afterwards. The Nationals failed to disclose a $1 million payment from a key financial supporter. Credit: Andrew Taylor The Nationals did not reveal the $1 million contribution from the investment vehicle, John McEwen House, even though the federal office only had $3.1 million in total receipts for the financial year covering the last election. (The $1 million payment appeared to be included in the total that was disclosed.) The mistake at one of the two Coalition parties heightens the dispute over integrity in politics when government MPs are accusing independent candidates and the Climate 200 campaign group of failing to disclose their funding. With independent MP Zali Steggall admitting a “rookie error” in failing to disclose the source of a $100,000 donation from the family of coal millionaire John Kinghorn, the $1 million correction by the Nationals leaves the government exposed to attack. The Australian Electoral Commission found the transfer in an audit into the Nationals last year and a subsequent audit into John McEwen House, the company linked to the building of the same name in Canberra, one of the party’s prize assets. “Individual receipts exceeding the threshold were under-disclosed in the party’s 2018–19 annual disclosure return,” the commission found in April last year. “In view of the discrepancies identified, the return did not comply with the provisions of sections 314AB and 314AC of the Electoral Act.” The Nationals federal director at the time, Ben Hindmarsh, signed off on the disclosure in October 2019 as the official “party agent” under electoral law but only reported $71,227 from John McEwen House. The current federal director of the Nationals, Jonathan Hawkes, confirmed the $1 million payment but only did so in April last year after AEC assistant commissioner Joanne Reid had identified the problem. “The amount you have noted was clearly identified as not being a donation. It was an internal financial transaction as a result of a restructure of the party’s administration,” Mr Hawkes said in response to questions from The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age . “The Nationals have always and will continue to abide by all legislative and regulatory requirements under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.” Mr Hindmarsh did not respond to a text message or phone call. Barrister Geoffrey Watson, an advocate for donations reform and a director of the Centre for Public Integrity, said the disclosure revealed problems in the Nationals office and in the transparency regime. “This is just another example of the problem of too much money sloshing around in politics. How can a party overlook a $1,000,000 payment?” Mr Watson said. “It doesn’t matter that it comes from a related entity; in some ways it makes it worse. I’ve read through the reports and cannot see a rational explanation for the oversight.” The corrected disclosure from the Nationals also listed a $77,000 receipt from law firm Minter Ellison and a $58,000 transfer from the Australian Tax Office. A separate donation of $32,000 had been disclosed in the return, but the AEC said it should be removed. While the company secretary at John McEwen House also lodged a formal return with the AEC after the last election, it also understated the amount given to the Nationals by $1 million and had to be corrected after an audit by the AEC. In the second audit, Ms Reid found the total payments from John McEwen House were $2.4 million rather than the $1.4 million claimed in its October 2019 disclosure. This led the company to lodge a corrected disclosure with the AEC in August last year, more than two years after the election. The AEC has about 30 compliance investigations underway at the moment. The use of the word “payment” in this news story refers to the specific amount of money and the name of the source of the money received by the Nationals.

			"full_description": "Health officials say proof of a third vaccine dose may be required to enter Victorian pubs and restaurants in coming months, as the government wound back most of the state’s COVID-19 restrictions. With Omicron cases and hospital admissions declining, the government announced on Thursday that density quotients would end, the QR code system would be used in fewer settings and dance floors would be allowed to reopen. Daniel Andrews announcing an easing of restrictions on Thursday. Credit: Chris Hopkins After previously supporting a booster mandate, Premier Daniel Andrews this week said it would be difficult to implement because the federal government has allowed travellers with two doses into the country. That decision came despite the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation last week stating people would be “overdue” for a vaccine after six months. A third dose mandate could therefore lead to an incongruent situation where a double-vaccinated local couldn’t enter a restaurant while a two-dosed tourist ate a steak inside, Mr Andrews said. Despite this, a well-placed Victorian health source, who was not authorised to speak publicly, said a third dose mandate was still being considered to protect against future waves of infections, while acknowledging some tourists may not have had equal time or access to a third dose. While there are no immediate plans for a third-dose mandate, the health official was canvassing policy options as booster uptake rose above the current level of 53 per cent of the eligible population and as the threat of a winter wave of cases approached. “The [general vaccinated economy mandate] can’t really push up two-dose coverage any more. We’re at 94 per cent with only a couple of hundred additional adults getting it each day. So we might get another 0.1 per cent only,” the source said. “A third-dose mandate would likely raise coverage … The [mandates] could be dropped if we all agree it’s not proportionate. Or it could remain as two doses and incorporate a third dose if needed.” Mr Andrews said unvaccinated Victorians will continue to be barred from restaurants and entertainment venues. “The future of the vaccinated economy ... is about balance,” he said on Thursday. “It’s about the proportional benefit that comes from it. It won’t be there forever.” Under changes announced on Thursday, dance floors will open and density quotients at hospitality venues will be removed from 6pm on Friday. However, indoor mask rules will remain for at least one more week. QR check-ins will no longer be needed in shops, schools and for employees at many workplaces but will continue in high-risk “vaccinated economy” sites such as restaurants and entertainment venues. The changes mirror similar moves announced in NSW on Thursday , with Premier Dominic Perrottet scrapping density limits and retaining QR codes only for nightclubs and large music festivals and indoor mask mandates in most venues. While Mr Perrottet lifted the work-from-home requirement, Mr Andrews said further announcements about mask requirements and return-to-work advice would be made at the end of next week. The decision to retain elements of the QR check-in system drew criticism from the hospitality industry , while Liberal Democrat MP David Limbrick said he was lobbying upper house MPs to support a motion to end vaccinated economy mandates and retain the rules only for groups such as healthcare workers. His motion will request the independent pandemic management oversight committee – an expert panel established under the government’s new pandemic legislation – to review the necessity for ongoing mandates. If successful, it would be the first time the expert body would exercise its role of scrutinising government pandemic orders. “Vaccination rates are very high and continuing this exclusion of 7 per cent of the population from society is fuelling division in society,” said Mr Limbrick, who is vaccinated but opposes mandates and regularly attended anti-government protests last year. NSW no longer requires people to show proof of vaccination to enter venues, and Opposition Leader Matthew Guy told The Age “Victoria [would] fall further behind” if it did not “move beyond lockouts to a commonsense approach that allows families, communities and businesses to move beyond COVID”. Credit: Matt Golding Restaurant and Catering Australia chief Wes Lambert said the industry was “flabbergasted” about the need to keep using QR codes when contact tracing was “all but pointless” at this stage of the pandemic. Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra called for the mask mandate to be scrapped, arguing it prevented staff from going back to the workplace. He also said the QR code system and the density requirements had served an important purpose but had now “passed their use-by date”. Deakin University’s epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said the government should either remove the check-in system or update the app so that it checked for three doses and notified people if they had been exposed to a positive case. The state could afford to do without the check-in system, given booster shot rates were rising and many of the unvaccinated would have probably been infected with Omicron, she said. “I have found it quite difficult looking at the level of social exclusion that’s based on an argument that scientists like myself find harder to back up now because there are so few with no immunity now.” University of Sydney infectious disease expert Professor Robert Booy said the system could be abolished by the end of March, when he estimated the daily death rate from COVID-19 could hit 20 or lower across the country or five or lower in Victoria. He said it was overkill to mandate booster shots. “I think we need to learn to get along as well as we can, within each state and across states, and I think we need to be practical and have common sense,” he said. Mandatory indoor mask rules are under review and could be scrapped next week, but its expected masks will still be compulsory in some settings. Credit: Justin McManus Victoria recorded 8501 cases and nine deaths on Thursday. Of the fatalities reported by authorities, seven occurred in the past week. There were 401 people in hospital with COVID-19, including 78 in ICU and 16 people on ventilators. Infectious diseases epidemiologist Paul Van Buynder said while the current QR system was imperfect as long as it only checked for two rather than three doses, it played a role in keeping case numbers down. “There’ll be people who are infected who can go into venues because they’ve got a tick, but opening it right up at this point of time, when we really don’t have it under control yet, I think is a step too far, too early.” Further changes announced by the government included mandatory surveillance COVID-19 testing for key industries, including meat processing, will also become recommended only. Requirements for hospital worker “bubbles” will also be removed. Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said the removal of density limits was good news for hospitality businesses and nightclubs “but we still need a plan for the return of office workers”. “The many CBD businesses that rely on weekday trade from office workers have been screaming out for a signal of when and how they can return, and they continue to languish while the bills mount up,” he said.
